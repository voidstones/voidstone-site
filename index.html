            There's only so far you can get with plugins that already exist when
            making your server stand out from the rest. Sure, some of them are a
            necessity, but what about ideas you came up with that don't already
            exist in plugin form? Maybe you need a full player management system for
            your massive server, or perhaps you want to complete a fun, custom
            challenge with your friends. Let us bring those ideas into reality.
